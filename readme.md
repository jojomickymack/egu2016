# EGU 2016 - Great Libktx Game!

This game was made by [czyzby](https://github.com/czyzby), [marszaa](https://github.com/marszaa), and [grafiszti](https://github.com/grafiszti).

All I did was re-organize the stucture of the project a little so it can be built with newer dependencies. The original project doesn't have 
an android build target but it happens to work great on android! It's easier to build this one, that's why I forked it.

This is one of the best examples from the creator of how ktx libraries are used - however this project uses an older version of libktx, so 
you'll notice the depedencies have a different hostname ('com.github.czyzby' instead of 'io.github.libktx' in the build.gradle files). Keep 
that in mind if you copy some parts of this! The latest version of libktx has different package structure and usage than what's in this game.

Besides being a good way to see what libktx contains, it's a really fun game!
